This mod reimplements almost all features of the popular Sekiro FPS Unlocker and more as a native DLL. Instead of relying on a separate, constantly running executable, this mod is just a DLL file that you need to put in your game directory, providing the same benefits with improved ease of use. This is especially beneficial for Linux users (Steam Deck included), where running Windows executables can be cumbersome, which is the reason I made this mod.
